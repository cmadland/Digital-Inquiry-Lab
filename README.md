## Digital Pedagogy at TWU

### What if I told you that learning management systems like Moodle are making it harder for your students to learn?

That's a bold and provocative question in some circles, but give me a few minutes and maybe you will see some disadvantages to the _status quo_.

LMSs are good for some things in education, but their name (at least in North America) belies their true utility. Ultimately, they are management systems. They make it easier for administrators and faculty to manage some logistics related to educational environments. They allow faculty to access an official roster for their class in any given semester; they are great file repositories for syllabi and PowerPoints; they allow for some efficiencies in assigning, receiving, grading and providing feedback on student work; and they have generally useful gradebook record-keeping features.

But there are some areas where they are less than useful, perhaps even more than less than useful.
* building and maintaining a community of learners over time
* allowing students to maintain ownership and control of their work
* encouraging connections and interactions outside the system
* sharing new knowledge with 'the public'
* building connections between ideas in different courses or disciplines
* supporting renewable assignments

It is these limitations that have me thinking about a broader concept of a digital learning environment at TWU. When we get locked into thinking about digital technologies as one-size-fits-all, we end up with one-size-fits-none.
