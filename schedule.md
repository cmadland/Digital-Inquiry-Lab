> Re: low tech…we have a PressBooks installation available and at least one of the faculty signed up for the lab is trying out a PressBooks assignment this term. Also, we have been promoting ‘Just One Change’ for faculty this year, so it would be good to help faculty get something designed that they can implement relatively quickly.  
>  I think that should bring us close to the time with a break  \(1/2\) in there.
